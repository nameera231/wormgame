# wormgame

A simple system for running a series of tasks within one process. 
This system will support the game Worm!, a clone of the classic game Snake.
Tasks in this system will run separate functions, and this scheduler will switch between them. 
These tasks will have the ability to perform blocking operations. 
At this point, your scheduler will need to stop running the current task and select a new one to run in the meaintime.
